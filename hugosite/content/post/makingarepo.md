Quickly choosing what tools you want to use to collaborate with each other is important. Luckily, the first hurdle, chat, was already taken care of. HackWimbledon already uses slack to keep folks talking so making a channel there for the WomBot project was not an issue.

Next up was exchanging files. Well, that choice was pretty simple too. Again HackWimbledon already had a GitHub repository and so we created a team and a repository for the WomBot in there too. Teams on GitHub are neat, they let you have conversations about projects which are attached to the team, not to any particular repository. 

Which was good, because pretty soon we'd be needing another repo for websites and other bits.
