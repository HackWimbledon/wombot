We did all our first planning session for WomBot in the Garden Shed. That's not a shed, that's a pub called the Garden Shed which is super convenient for us.

The discussion went far and wide over possible bots we could build, names for those bots, designs for those bots and well anything bot related. But we knew one thing. We were going to make a bot and it was going to have... a name.
