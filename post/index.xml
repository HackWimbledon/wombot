      <description>So as an experiment, we&amp;rsquo;ve created this blog. We&amp;rsquo;re using Hugo a static site generator and Github&amp;rsquo;s Pages to publish it. The instructions came from the Hugo site and seem to work ok, though git skills are to the fore if you go the gh-pages route.</description>

      <description>Quickly choosing what tools you want to use to collaborate with each other is important. Luckily, the first hurdle, chat, was already taken care of. HackWimbledon already uses slack to keep folks talking so making a channel there for the WomBot project was not an issue.
Next up was exchanging files. Well, that choice was pretty simple too. Again HackWimbledon already had a GitHub repository and so we created a team and a repository for the WomBot in there too.</description>

      <description>We did all our first planning session for WomBot in the Garden Shed. That&amp;rsquo;s not a shed, that&amp;rsquo;s a pub called the Garden Shed which is super convenient for us.
The discussion went far and wide over possible bots we could build, names for those bots, designs for those bots and well anything bot related. But we knew one thing. We were going to make a bot and it was going to have&amp;hellip; a name.</description>
