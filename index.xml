      <description>Quickly choosing what tools you want to use to collaborate with each other is important. Luckily, the first hurdle, chat, was already taken care of. HackWimbledon already uses slack to keep folks talking so making a channel there for the WomBot project was not an issue.
Next up was exchanging files. Well, that choice was pretty simple too. Again HackWimbledon already had a GitHub repository and so we created a team and a repository for the WomBot in there too.</description>

      <description>We did all our first planning session for WomBot in the Garden Shed. That&amp;rsquo;s not a shed, that&amp;rsquo;s a pub called the Garden Shed which is super convenient for us.</description>
