So as an experiment, we've created this blog. We're using Hugo a static site generator and Github's Pages to publish it. The instructions came from the [Hugo site](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) and seem to work ok, though git skills are to the fore if you go the gh-pages route.
